# tower_counterfactual
This project develops a counterfactual simulation model of physical stability.

## Running code
The Javascript code runs in NodeJS.

You can the run the code in `code/js`. You can open an interface by running `node web_interface.js` and navigating to `localhost:8000/interface/physics_interface.js`, and experiment with the trials we have used in our experiment.

Other detailed instructions are in the README file in the `code/js` folder.
